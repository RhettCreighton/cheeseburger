# Test Coverage Improvements

## Summary of Changes

We've significantly improved the test coverage of the routes package by:

1. Adding comprehensive API route tests for all CRUD operations:
   - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for posts
   - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for comments
   - Error handling tests for various edge cases

2. Adding web route tests for the MVC part of the application:
   - GET endpoints for list and detail views
   - POST endpoints for form submissions
   - Static file serving tests

3. Adding helper function tests:
   - setupTestData 
   - getNextID
   - marshalEntity

## Coverage Results

Overall code coverage has increased from 18.9% to 42.1%, primarily due to:

- 100% coverage of StartServer
- 100% coverage of setupTestTemplates
- 100% coverage of setupTestDB
- 100% coverage of marshalEntity
- 80% coverage of setupTestData
- 81.2% coverage of getNextID

## Coverage Gaps

The main areas still lacking coverage are:

- SetupRoutes (0%) 
- SetupMVCRoutes (0%)

These functions have dependencies that make them difficult to test in isolation, and would need more complex mocking or integration tests to cover.

## Next Steps

Future test coverage improvements could focus on:

1. Creating more focused tests for SetupRoutes and SetupMVCRoutes
2. Adding integration tests that use the actual application setup
3. Adding tests for edge cases in the route handlers
4. Implementing mocks for external dependencies to facilitate testing
